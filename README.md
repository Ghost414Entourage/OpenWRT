----> happiness is only real when shared..........



The Constitution would never have come into existence without a group united by a simple guiding principle,

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

For example, some groups claim to prioritize Americans first or focus on student loans, yet they support sending twice as much money overseas while labeling themselves with terms like 'teabags.' But what does 'teabag' even mean, and what is the definition of a 'loan'—who does it actually apply to? 



Does Netflix require you to complete 80 hours of community service after you’ve paid your subscription fee? Why does my netflix account require a password when oversea loans dont need one to access my subscription? 



Everything you do in America is taxed, I am not complaining about those fees, but let me benefit from the wrap around services you provide people without a real id or passport.
